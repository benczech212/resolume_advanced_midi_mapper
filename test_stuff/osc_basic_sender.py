"""Simple OSC sender for testing the OSC receiver.

This script creates a :class:`~pythonosc.udp_client.SimpleUDPClient` and
sends a series of test messages to ``127.0.0.1:7001``.  It can be used in
conjunction with ``osc_basic_receiver.py`` to verify that OSC messages
are transmitted and received correctly.  Adjust the IP address and
port as needed to target a different receiver.
